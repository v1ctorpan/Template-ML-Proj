# Template ML Proj
This project aims at helping building your own Machine Learning code with some basic coding frame, such as different functional files and basic logical training process.
## File Structure
```

├── __init__.py             // Python init file
├── datawork.py              // You can put your `data processing` func here
├── model.py                 // You can put your `model` here
├── training.py              // You can put your `training` func here
├── main.py                  // The main func to start your whole proj
├── config.yaml              // Define your hyperparameters
└── data                    // Put your data here
    ├── covid_train.csv     // Train data
